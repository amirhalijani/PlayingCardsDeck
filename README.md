<h2>🃏 Playing Cards Deck Project</h2>

In this project, I, as an independent developer, created an engaging and practical programming project called Playing Cards Deck. This project provided me with the opportunity to showcase my programming skills and expertise in the Golang programming language.

<h2>🎲 Key Operations</h2>

The project includes operations such as creating card decks, printing decks, shuffling cards, dealing cards to players, and saving/retrieving decks from files.
