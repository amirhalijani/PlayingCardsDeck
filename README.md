<h2>üÉè Playing Cards Deck</h2>

This project is a package developed using the Golang programming language, in which a simulation of the Playing Cards Deck is created. In this project, cards such as Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, etc., used in games like Black Jack, Gin Rummy, Go Fish, and Poker are present. Within this package, several essential functions exist that allow simulating various operations performed on a real deck of cards. Functions like newDeck, shuffle, and deal each have their respective responsibilities and perform specific operations.
